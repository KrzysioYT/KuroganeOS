## 4.0 Pre-Steel / KuroFS 1.0

Status: **ACTIVE**.

Active work starts with persistent KuroFS allocation primitives on top of the production `storage::block::Device` contract. The first slice is limited to safe persistent allocation of contiguous data extents and inode records with remount persistence, metadata protection, bounded scanning and explicit no-space behavior. File/directory mutation and reclamation follow only after allocator durability is proven.
